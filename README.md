## 1. Method


 1. Capture the entire screen area and save it to the clipboard

 	* Command ⌘ + Control + Shift + 3

 2. Capture entire screen area and save it to a file on your desktop
 
 	* Command ⌘ + Shift + 3

## 2. Method

This method will help you capture a selected area of our screen such as the menu bar, opened applications, some part of the desktop, some application window, or anything else. This is a slightly more “advanced” method, but it is beneficial to get used to it. I use this method a lot, but you have to repeat it to memorize and learn how to use it properly on your Mac.

1. Capture selected screen area and save it to the clipboard for further use in apps

	* Press the Command ⌘ + Control + Shift + 4 (for older Mac versions use Apple key ⌘+ Control + Shift + 4) all at the same time.
	* You will notice that your mouse cursor changes to “+” with pixel coordinates on the right side
	* Now click and drag a box around the section that you want to capture and release the mouse button when you are done
	* Now screen capture is saved on the clipboard for further use in apps

2. Capture selected screen area and save it to a file on your desktop

	* Press the Command ⌘ + Shift + 4 (for older Mac versions use Apple key ⌘ + Shift + 4) all at the same time.
	* You will notice that your mouse cursor changes to “+” with pixel coordinates on the right side
	* Now click and drag a box around the section that you want to capture and release the mouse button when you are done
	* Now screen capture is saved on a PNG file on your desktop (if not otherwise specified)

## 3. Method

This method will help you save a print screen of a particular application window such as a web browser, Keynote, Pages, Numbers, or others.

1. Capture a screenshot of a particular app window and save it to the clipboard

	* Command ⌘ + Control + Shift + 4
	* You will notice that your mouse cursor changes to “+” with pixel coordinates on the right side
	* Now with spacebar (that very wide button on your keyboard )
	* Now click on the window you would like to capture in a screenshot
	* The screenshot is now saved on your clipboard for further use in apps

2. Capture a screenshot of a particular app window and save it to a file on your desktop

	* Command ⌘ + Shift + 4
	* You will notice that your mouse cursor changes to “+” with pixel coordinates on the right side
	* Now with space bar (that wide button on your keyboard )
	* Now click on the window you would like to capture in a screenshot
	* The screenshot is now saved on a PNG file on your desktop (if not otherwise specified)
